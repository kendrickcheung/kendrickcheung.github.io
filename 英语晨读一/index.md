### 2. 南非议会被烧毁（South Africa's parliament burns）

A large fire damaged `much of` the Houses of Parliament on Sunday.

Officials warned that the damage to the historic(有历史意义的，historical：古老的) `complex` would be `extensive`.

官员警告说，历史性`建筑群`的损失无疑是`广泛的`。

Officials said the fire spread from an office space on the third of a building adjacent(英[əˈdʒeɪsnt]
美[əˈdʒeɪsnt]
) to the old National Assembly building. 

官员说，大火从靠近旧国会大楼的一栋大楼三楼的一个办公空间蔓延开来的。

### 3. 欧盟考虑一个非自由主义的领导人是否为同一阵线(E.U considers whether an illiberal leader belongs)

Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, proudly {{< popover origin="refers to his country as" title="refer to ... as: 把...看作/称为..." >}}
*e.g.* He refers to Jane as his grilfriend.
{{< /popover >}} "illiberal state." `Yet` he has long been treated as just another leader by the Europe Union, which `holds itself up as` a `model` of human rights and the rule of law.

匈牙利总理Vitor Orban自豪地称他的国家是一个“非自由主义国家”。`然而`，长期以来，他被欧盟视为仅仅是另一个欧盟的领导人，欧盟则`将自己视为`人权和法治的`典范`。

But as Orban has continued to `consolidate` power and weaken his country's `democratic`(英[ˌdeməˈkrætɪk]美[ˌdeməˈkrætɪk]) institutions, the bloc is trying to `rein him in`. Early this year, the European Court of Justice will `issue a decision on` whether the union has the authority to make its funds to memeber states {{< popover origin="conditional on" title="conditional on: 以...为条件" >}}
*e.g.* His compromise is conditional on gaining a lot of money.
{{< /popover >}} meeting the bloc's core values. Doing so may {{< popover origin="block Hungary from billions of euros" title="block sb. from sths: 阻止某人获得某物" >}}
*e.g.* His aunt is trying to block him from a legacy of $500,00
{{< /popover >}}.

但是，随着Orban继续`巩固`权力并削弱其他国家的`民主`机构，欧盟试图`抑制他`。今年年初，欧洲法院就欧盟是否有权以符合欧盟核心价值观为条件向成员国提供资金而`做出裁决`。这样做可能会阻止匈牙利获得数十亿的资金。

随着Omicron`浪潮`在上个月开始，总理Modi敦促全国人民`保持警惕`。德里地区的首席部长Arind Kejriwal实行了`宵禁`，关闭了电影院并且`削减了`餐馆和公共运输的容纳人数。
