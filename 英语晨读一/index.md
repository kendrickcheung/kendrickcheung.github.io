### 南非议会被烧毁（South Africa's parliament burns）

A large fire damaged `much of` the Houses of Parliament on Sunday.

周日，一场大火烧毁了议会大厦的`大部分`地方。

Officials warned that the damage to the historic(有历史意义的，historical：古老的) `complex` would be `extensive`.

官员警告说，历史性`建筑群`的损失无疑是`广泛的`。

Officials said the fire spread from an office space on the third of a building adjacent(英[əˈdʒeɪsnt]
美[əˈdʒeɪsnt]
) to the old National Assembly building. 

官员说，大火从靠近旧国会大楼的一栋大楼三楼的一个办公空间蔓延开来的。

Cape Town's Fire and `rescue Service` spokesman warned that the buildings themselves `were at risk of collapse`, `given` the `intense heat of the fire`.

开普敦的消防和`救援服务`发言人警告说，`鉴于`这个`火势猛烈`，建筑本身`存在倒塌的风险`

### 欧盟考虑一个非自由主义的领导人是否为同一阵线(E.U considers whether an illiberal leader belongs)

Viktor Orban, Hungary's prime minister, proudly {{< popover origin="refers to his country as" title="refer to ... as: 把...看作/称为..." >}}
*e.g.* He refers to Jane as his grilfriend.
{{< /popover >}} "illiberal state." `Yet` he has long been treated as just another leader by the Europe Union, which `holds itself up as` a `model` of human rights and the rule of law.

匈牙利总理Vitor Orban自豪地称他的国家是一个“非自由主义国家”。`然而`，长期以来，他被欧盟视为仅仅是另一个欧盟的领导人，欧盟则`将自己视为`人权和法治的`典范`。

But as Orban has continued to consolidate power and weaken his country's democratic(英[ˌdeməˈkrætɪk]美[ˌdeməˈkrætɪk]) institutions, the bloc is trying to `rein him in`. Early this year, the European Court of Justice will `issue a decision` on whether the union has the authority to make its funds to memeber states {{< popover origin="conditional on" title="conditional on: 以...为条件" >}}
*e.g.* His compromise is conditional on gaining a lot of money.
{{< /popover >}} meeting the bloc's core values. Doing so may {{< popover origin="block Hungary from billions of euros" title="block sb. from sths: 阻止某人获得某物" >}}
*e.g.* His aunt is trying to block him from a legacy of $500,00
{{< /popover >}}.

但是，随着Orban继续巩固权力并削弱其他国家的民主机构，欧盟试图`抑制他`。今年年初，欧洲法院就欧盟是否有权以符合欧盟核心价值观为条件向成员国提供资金而`做出裁决`。这样做可能会阻止匈牙利获得数十亿的资金。

### 菲律宾对未接种疫苗的人实行隔离-A lockdown for the unvaccinated in the Philippines

The Philippines will bar all unvaccinated residents from leaving their homes, `except for` essential reassons, in Manila and the surrounding areas. The lockdown `is in response to` `post-holiday` `spike` in Covid-19 cases.

菲律宾将 {{< popover origin="禁止" title="bar sb. from sth.: 禁止某人做某事" >}}
*e.g.* Her monther bar her from leaving home.
{{< /popover >}} 马尼拉及周边地区未接种疫苗的剧名离开家门，`除非`有必要的原因。隔离是为了`应对` `放假后`Covid-19病例的`激增`。

The lockdown is aimed at both lessening the country's caseload and encouraging vaccinations. Health officials have suggested that vaccine `complacency` `was behind` the latest rise in infections. "Despite the availability of vaccines, there is number of individuals who `adamantly` opt not to be vacinated", the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority said in a statment.

隔离的目的是减少该国的病例数和鼓励接种疫苗。卫生官员表示，最近感染率上升`背后的原因是`对疫苗政策过于`自满`。马尼拉市发展局在一份声明中说：“尽管有疫苗，仍然有一些人`坚决`选择不接种。

### Omicron给印度带来了似曾相识的感觉-Omicron brings a sense of deja vu to India
Just a few months ago, as government leaders `vastly under estimated` the dangers and publicly `flouted` official advice, the Delta variant ravaged India. Now, `with the rise of` Omicron, the mixed signals from the government and `rapid spread` through cities `are fueling` a sense of deja vu.

就在几个月前，由于政府领导人`大大低估了`危险性并公开`蔑视`官方建议，Delta变体肆虐了印度。现在，随着Omicron的兴起，来自政府的混杂信息和在城市中的`快速传播`正在`助长`一种似曾相识的感觉。

As the Omicron `wave` began last month, Prime Minister Narenra Modi urged the nation `to be vigilant`. Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of the Delhi region, introduced `night curfews`, shut down movie theaters and `slashed` capacity in restaurants and public transport.

随着Omicron`浪潮`在上个月开始，总理Modi敦促全国人民`保持警惕`。德里地区的首席部长Arind Kejriwal实行了`宵禁`，关闭了电影院并且`削减了`餐馆和公共运输的容纳人数。
