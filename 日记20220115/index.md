Today was an amazing day! I woke up and had a yummy breakfast of waffles and strwberries. Then I went to school and learned about different types of animals in science class. We even got to see a video of a lion and a tiger.

After school, I went to the park with my best friends. We played on the playground and had a race to see who could run the fastest. I didn't win but it was still so much fun!

When I got home. I helped my mom make dinner. We made yummy macaroni and cheese and I even got to stir the pot. After dinner, I played with my toys and then it was bedtime.

Before I went to sleep, I read a story about a brave knight who saved a princess. It was so exiting! I can't wait to read more tomorrow.
