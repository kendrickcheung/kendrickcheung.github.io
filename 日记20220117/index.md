Today was so much fun! I woke up in the morning and had a tasty breakfast of pancakes and syrup. Then I went to school and learned about different types of plant in science class. I even got to plant my own seed in class.

When I got home. I helped my mom make dinner. We made yummy tacos and I got to choose my own toppings. After dinner, I played with my toys and then it was time for bed.

Before I went to sleep. I read a story about a brave mouse who saved his friends. It was so exiting and I could't put the book down!
